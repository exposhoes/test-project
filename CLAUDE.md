# Claude Code Game Studios -- Game Studio Agent Architecture

Indie game development managed through 49 coordinated Claude Code subagents.
Each agent owns a specific domain, enforcing separation of concerns and quality.

## Technology Stack

- **Game**: EmirCRAFT — Minecraft benzeri mobil voxel oyunu (Android). Oyun içi metinler ve commit mesajları Türkçe.
- **Engine**: Godot 4 (proje `config/features` 4.3; yerelde Godot 4.7.2 ile derleniyor), GL Compatibility renderer
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Version Control**: Git, çalışma dalı `claude/project-thread-zypky7`
- **Build System**: `godot --headless --path . --export-debug "Android" export/EmirCRAFT.apk` (preset: `export_presets.cfg`, arm64 + x86_64). Emülatöre kurmak için `tools/run_android.ps1`
- **Tests**: `godot --headless --path . --script res://tests/smoke_test.gd`; yaratık önizleme `tests/mob_preview.gd`
- **Asset Pipeline**: Yaratık yüzleri `assets/textures/mobs/mob_<kod>_face.png` (32 px), konseptler `docs/konseptler/`, modeller `scripts/mobs/mob_data.gd`

> **Note**: Engine-specialist agents exist for Godot, Unity, and Unreal with
> dedicated sub-specialists. Use the set matching your engine.

## Project Structure

@.claude/docs/directory-structure.md

## Engine Version Reference

<!-- ENGINE-REFERENCE-IMPORT: the line below is engine-specific. /setup-engine
     rewrites it to @docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md for the chosen
     engine, so a Unity or Unreal project stops loading the Godot reference every
     session. It defaults to Godot (the template's example engine); skills that
     need the pinned version read docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md on
     demand regardless of this import. -->
@docs/engine-reference/godot/VERSION.md


## Technical Preferences

`project.yaml` at the repo root is the primary config store — engine, specialists,
naming, platform, performance, modes. Skills resolve it via `resolve_config`
(see `.claude/docs/config-resolution.md`).

`.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` is the **legacy fallback**, read on demand
when a key is absent from `project.yaml`. It is no longer imported here: before
`/setup-engine` runs it is almost entirely `[TO BE CONFIGURED]` placeholders, and
after it runs `project.yaml` holds the real values.

## Coordination Rules

@.claude/docs/coordination-rules.md

## Collaboration Protocol

**User-driven collaboration, not autonomous execution.**
Every task follows: **Question -> Options -> Decision -> Draft -> Approval**

- Agents MUST ask "May I write this to [filepath]?" before using Write/Edit tools
- Agents MUST show drafts or summaries before requesting approval
- Multi-file changes require explicit approval for the full changeset
- No commits without user instruction

See `docs/COLLABORATIVE-DESIGN-PRINCIPLE.md` for full protocol and examples.

> **First session?** If the project has no engine configured and no game concept,
> run `/start` to begin the guided onboarding flow.

## Coding Standards

## Context Management

Read `.claude/docs/context-management.md` on demand — it is a reference, not
session context. Two of its conventions are load-bearing and cited by name
elsewhere in the repo, so they are restated here rather than lost:

- **`production/session-state/active.md` is the session checkpoint.** The file is
  the memory, not the conversation. Read it first after any compaction, crash, or
  `/clear`.
- **Helpers in `.claude/scripts/` emit observations, never verdicts.** A script
  that scores or judges will eventually contradict a mode or override it cannot
  see. (Cited by `artifact-check.sh` and `adr-dep-graph.sh`.)
